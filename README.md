# phishing-site-detection - Samarth Mistry

**APPROCH:**

*The key idea is using Support vector machine (SVM) we can design a model that will first get hyperplane for SVM from training 
dataset and the for confirming it's working we will test it using testing data which is 20% of given dataset.*

**TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES**

*I have used google colab platform for designing this model.
Furthermore, some required libraries like Pandas, Matplot, Numpy are used.
Finally as we aim at classifying weather the site is phishing or legitimate, we have use SVM approach,
If the site is phishing the Result variable will be 1 else 0 for legitimate.*

**ACCURACY**

*As we get the accuracy above 90 percent we can say it works quite well with the given data.*
Accuracy :
	Training data: 95.11202%
	Test data: 93.69919%
